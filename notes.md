# Elixir Notes

## Integers and Floats

ints can be arbitrarily big (within the limits of available memory).\
They can be written with underscores between them, usually to denote commas.\
`123_456_789`

`0x`, `0o`, `0b` prefixes indicate literals using hex, octal, binary notation.

`?c` is the codepoint of the UTF character `c`.
